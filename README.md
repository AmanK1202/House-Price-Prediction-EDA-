# House-Price-Prediction-EDA
This repository contains the RMD file (along with R code), the project's supplementary materials (Datasets) along with a full report describing the project. The report is self sufficient and can referred to get insights out of the entire project. The report is more than a mere summary as it contains all the visualizations (and their descriptions) that aided the EDA analysis. Hence, the RMD file is only required for code execution purposes.

The data set chosen is ‘House Price Prediction’ from Kaggle. This dataset involves 79 explanatory features that are used in predicting house prices in the US. It is a regression problem of predicting house prices of new data points given previous house prices in accordance with quantitative and categorical explanatory variables. For EDA purposes we have chosen 7 meaningful variables out of which one is the target variable of ‘sale price’. The motive and goal of this project are to get insights and relationships amongst the variables which might prove to be useful in deciding factors responsible for deciding the house prices.

The research question have been answered in the file named Executive-Summary
